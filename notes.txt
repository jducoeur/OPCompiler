Notes on the OP Compiler
========================

Some of this might become comments or more formal documentation eventually, but for
now I just want to make sure it's written down.

I am currently assuming that the input files are all properly-formatted XHTML. The
originals, of course, are nothing of the sort, so they need to be run through
TagSoup first, with a command along the lines of:

java -jar ..\..\tagsoup-1.2.1.jar --files --nobogons *.html


Note that, in the data\awards folder, we assume that each file matches the name of
a known Award.


TODOs:
-- Need to add ability to parse "Baron of the Bridge", which requires synonyms for <barony>
-- Need to cope with parsing mm/dd/yyyy dates in the title of court reports (eg, Edward)
-- Need a way to interpret the various "court of" annotations in a number of court reports.
   I suspect that this will require a standardized format, and lots of manual adjustments.
-- Make Unknown Date into an error, since it usually indicates something's wrong
-- Fill the rest of the list into the Kingdom enumeration
