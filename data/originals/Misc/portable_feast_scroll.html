</head>
<body>
In order to encourage elegance
<br>and grace in dining among the
<br>people of this Kingdom, I, Nicor-
<br>lynn of Caer Wydyr, hereby
<br>establish
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Order of the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Portable Feast
<br>to be presented at the Crown Tourn-
<br>aments, Coronation Festivals, and
<br>Twelfth Night Celebration, to that
<br>person who there sets forth the best
<br>arrayed table for themselves, their
<br>households or the Kingdom.&nbsp; The
<br>tables shall be judged both on the
<br>quality of the food and on the state
<br>of the setting.
<br>The holder of the order shall maintain
<br>the footed bowl, symbol of this
<br>order, and this scroll, which is its
<br>statute, and shall affix their name
<br>thereto.
<br>The current holder, at the next event
<br>where this award shall be given,
<br>shall decide of his or her own opin-
<br>ion who, save themselves, shall be
<br>the next recipient of the order, and
<br>shall present it to them that day.
<br>If they are unable to attend said
<br>event, then shall they deliver this
<br>scroll and the footed bowl to some
<br>trusted person who shall act in
<br>their stead.
<br>Done by my hand and first present-
<br>ed at Crown Tournament, 29 May,
<br>XI A.S.
