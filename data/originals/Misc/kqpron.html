<h1>PRONUNCIATION GUIDE TO THE ROLL OF KINGS AND QUEENS OF THE EAST</h1>
<p><i>[NOTE: this page was by Master Steffan ap Cennydd, and the original seems to have been lost in the 
shutdown of Geocities. Thanks to the <a href="http://www.archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, I've copied the guts here. -- Justin]</i></p>
<hr>
<em><strong>Important Note:</strong> I use the convention that each
reign is a different person, so that (e.g.) Akbar's second reign is
Akbar II, not
Akbar I part 2. I understand that the latter convention is used in
other realms. If there is ever another king named Akbar in the East, I
will list him as Akbar IV. If you object, start your own page %^).
</em><p>
<em><strong>A General Note:</strong> If I were to give a single bit of
advice
on the pronunciation of "foreign" names in general, it would be this:
lose
the broad English "a" as in "hat"! Assume that an "a" is pronounced as
in
"aah", not "hat", and you will do wonders for your pronunciation of
these names. There are exceptions, of course, as in Maragorn and Alpin,
but say AHKbar, morGAHnah, KAHdizhah, MOORahd, zheHAHN, etc. etc.</em></p><p>

{1} also pronounced "CARRY-a-doc"<br>
{2} One also frequently hears "IZZ-a-boe" but Her Grace confirms that
this is incorrect and that "EESS-a-boe" is the correct pronunciation.<br>
{3} or "ee-SAULT"<br>
{4} or "ee-AHN-tay"<br>
{5} rhymes with "Hayden"<br>
{6} or "ZIG-freed"<br>
{7} -GUHN- has the sound of "oo" in "look"<br>
{8} sometimes pronounced "roe-AIN"<br>
{9) BAL as in "balance"<br>
{10} Not "ACK"!<br>
{11} Often pronounced "Shannon". Seanan actually reigned as "Setanta"
(sheh-TAHN-tah) but this name was rejected by the College of Heralds during
his reign.<br>
{12} Or Lukanos V Drakonteiokeles [loo-KAHN-ose drah-kon-tay-OCK-uh-leez]<br>
{13} Queen Jana III and IV affected the pronunciation "YAH-nah" and the spelling
"Yana". It is wise to indulge royalty in these matters %^).<br>
{14} Queen Amber's registered name was Ekaterina Amber of Tospenwood,
but she used only "Amber" as her regnal name.<br>
(15) Also frequently pronounced "rox-ah-NAY".<br>
(16) His Majesty's full name is Gaufred Kelson von Heidelberg, and
he has often been called "Kelson".<br>
(17) Also called "Thorson" but Thorvald is his registered name.<br>
(18) It could be argued that Queen Aikaterine is Aikaterine II,
but as Queen Ekaterina Amber spelled her name <em>slightly</em>
differently, and didn't actually use her first name at all during her
reign...I'm just not
going to worry about it %^). Likewise, Princess Gabriella's name is
likely considered different from Gabrielle. Scribes should note though,
that in Latin (e.g.) Queen Aikaterine would be Caterina III (or maybe
IV if you count Queen Amber as a "Caterina") and Queen Gabriella I
would be Gabriella III. But this is the stuff that only protocol geeks
would worry about <grin>.<br>
{19} TH as in "thin", not "thee" or "thick".
