FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions about the East Kingdom Order of Precedence</h2>

<h3>

<hr WIDTH="100%">What does the little star mean in front of some of the
names?&nbsp; Why don't I have one too?</h3>
The little star means that the name is registered with the College of Arms
of the Society for Creative Anachronism.&nbsp; If you don't have a little
star, either your name isn't registered, or I haven't recently checked
the new registrations list and noticed that it got registered.
<h3>
You don't have my most recent award listed.&nbsp; Why?</h3>
Several possibilities:&nbsp; 1) I haven't done the data entry for that
court yet.&nbsp; 2) There is a mistake on the court report.&nbsp; 3) It
is listed, but under some other (mis-) spelling of your name, and I didn't
recognize that it was you.&nbsp; 4) I made a mistake in the data-entry
process.
<h3>
You don't have my baronial award listed.&nbsp; Why?</h3>
Very few of the baronial heralds file their court reports as required by
the Brigantia Herald's policy.&nbsp; Please ask your local herald, or baron/baroness,
to contact me.
<h3>
Why can't you spell my name the way I like it?</h3>
I use the registered spelling of a name, if it is registered.&nbsp; Sometimes,
that isn't the spelling you like best.&nbsp; If your name is not registered,
I will use your preferred spelling.&nbsp; Please let me know.
<h3>
I changed my name and you didn't move my awards to my new name.&nbsp; Why?</h3>
Probably I didn't know about the name change.&nbsp; Please let me know.&nbsp;
Cross-references between the two names are also possible if they are quite
different.
<h3>
Some of my awards are listed under a different name.&nbsp; Can I get them
grouped under the name I use most often?</h3>
Yes, of course.&nbsp; Almost certainly I hadn't realized that the two names
were for one person.&nbsp; Cross-references between the two names are also
possible.&nbsp; Please let me know.
<h3>
I have nonstandard characters in my name.&nbsp; Can you use those in your
records?</h3>
Probably.&nbsp; My fonts accommodate many non-English characters, including
accents, cedillas, tildes, umlauts, thorns, and more.&nbsp; However, in
concession to our North American audience, I do not use other alphabets
such as Cyrillic or Chinese, sorry.&nbsp; Please contact me.
<h3>
I just moved into the East.&nbsp; How can I get listed on the Order of
Precedence?</h3>
Please forward a list of your awards, with the date received (and kingdom,
if that isn't clear).&nbsp; Alternatively, you may ask the precedence herald
of your former kingdom of residence to contact me.&nbsp; Please do not
use abbreviations in the award names -- I may not recognize them.
<h3>
My friends just moved out of the kingdom.&nbsp; Shouldn't you take them
off the Order of Precedence?</h3>
I will take them out of the Alphabetic section, which is just current residents
of the East.&nbsp; Any awards they received while in the East will stay
on the rolls of the awards (such as Award of Arms, or Silver Crescent)
forever, as those are complete historical lists.&nbsp; Please let me know,
or have them let me know.&nbsp; I can also forward a list of honors received
to their new kingdom of residence, if desired.
<h3>
One of the members of our local group has died.&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you need
to know?</h3>
If I am notified, I will mark their name with (&sect;) which is how I mark
those gentles who have passed on.
